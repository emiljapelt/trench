The frontend language is a really simple, high level language with only one type, the signed integer, and no functions (scripting language).

Wanted features:
- if-statement
- goto's
- labels (the 'start' label is the program entrypoint)
- scopes/blocks
- variables (declaration, assignment)



example:
'
start:

#i = 5;

loop:
fortify;
expand(E);
move(E);
if (i) goto loop;

move(W);
move(W);

#t = scan(N);
if (t) {
    bomb(?x,t);
}

goto start;
