Trench is a game played by programming. Players write scripts, which describes how their character will behave during the game. A game file is then written, configuring settings, team setups and the board. This can then be executed, last team standing wins!

The ([language](doc/language.md)) that the players write, is split into themes and feature sets. These can be enabled, and disabled, in the game file, changing what players are allow to do.

The game is split into rounds, in which each character will take turns executing a part of their program. A limit on the number of instructions and actions that a character can execute on their turn is enforced to end a turn.
