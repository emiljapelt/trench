The program which run games. Takes some parameters, like gamerules, player settings etc.

gamerule ideas:
- directive rules
    - static, keeps the same player directive throuout the entire game
    - dynamic 'x', the players can change directive after 'x' rounds
    - nuke dynamic 'x', the players can change directive after 'x' rounds, and after x rounds every space is bombed
- maximum steps per turn
- board layout
    - size
    - generated/empty/file
- teams
    - free for all, every player has their own id
    - two-sided, players are split into teams, i.e. everyone on a team has the same id.


player settings:
    - color
    - starting step
    - starting directive


A player directive is just a string of characters, which the engine interprets to update player and game states.

Directive instructions:
- W: Waits, aka. end of turn
- E{n|e|s|w}: Expand trench in some direction
- c{n|e|s|w}: Checks if there is trench is some direction, 1 meaing yes, 0 meaning no. Checks only for player controlled trenches.
- m{n|e|s|w}: Move in some direction, only via trenches
- F: Fortify trench here
- f: check if here is fortified, 1 meaing yes, 0 meaning no.
- B: Bomb a coordinate, taken for the stack, first x then y
    - Bombing destroys an unfortified trench
    - Bombing kills a player in an unfortified trench
    - Bombing unfortifies a fortified trench
- p i: Place i on the player stack
- {+, -, *, /}: Operates on the player stack
- s{n|e|s|w}: Scan in some direction, placing the distance to the nears trench on the stack, or 0 if there is none
- x: Place the players x coordinate on the stack
- y: Place the players y coordinate on the stack
- ? i: if the top stack value is non-zero goto step 'i'
- ! i: goto step 'i'
- a: Assign a value onto the stack, from info on the stack. The first value is the stack address, the second is the value
