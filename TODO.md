- Implement functions?

- Direction operators
    - Fix subtraction/counter-clockwise

- Consider new inter directive comms (current: global arrays)
    - Private arrays
    - Field data

- Consider how bombing works
    - Currently bombs are explode immediatly, because the bomb chain was error prone
    - But maybe the delay from the bomb chain is good for balance
        - If so, a new implementation is needed

- Refactor visuals of instructions
    - Some are a bit hasty
