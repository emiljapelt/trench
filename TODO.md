- Language feature levels
    - A game rule sets the level, and the compiler must then check for adherence
    - FL0 are core features, that must exist (move, labels, trench, shoot, goto, ...)
    - FL1 are basic features, (repeat, if-else)
    - FL2 are memory features, (registers, assignment, lookup)
    - FL3 are advanced features, (loops, switch, functions?)

- Implement switch-statement
    - sugar for if-else
- Implement loops (while & for)
- Implement functions?

- Direction operators
    - Fix subtraction/counter-clockwise

- Consider 'repeat'
    - Either remove, or create an early compile step, which expands these

- Update README.md
